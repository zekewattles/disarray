# INDETERMINACY
Indeterminacy is a composing approach in which some aspects of a work are left open to chance or to the interpreter’s free choice.

John Cage, a pioneer of indeterminacy, defined it as “the ability of a piece to be performed in substantially different ways.”

This is a tool for creating graphic works based on the concept of composing with indeterminacy.
