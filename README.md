# INDETERMINACY
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminacy_(music)' target='_blank'>Indeterminacy</a> is a composing approach in which some aspects of a work are left open to chance or to the interpreter’s free choice.

<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage' target='_blank'>John Cage</a>, a pioneer of indeterminacy, defined it as “the ability of a piece to be performed in substantially different ways.”

This is a tool for creating graphic works based on the concept of composing with indeterminacy.
